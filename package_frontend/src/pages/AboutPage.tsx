          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            CulverBot was founded in 2023 by a group of university students who were frustrated with
            the lack of efficient delivery options on campus. Whether it was textbooks, lab
            materials, or personal items, getting things from one side of campus to another was
            always a challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a small operation with just three couriers has grown into a campus-wide
            service with a team of dedicated delivery personnel serving thousands of students and
            faculty members every semester.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is simple: to provide the fastest, most reliable courier service on campus,
            making life easier for everyone in our university community.
